Caesar Cipher Program
Overview
This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher, a classic cryptographic algorithm. The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in a message by a specified number of positions in the alphabet. The program allows users to both encrypt and decrypt messages using a shift value of their choice.

Features
Encryption: Converts a plain text message into an encrypted message by shifting the letters.
Decryption: Reverts an encrypted message back to plain text by reversing the shift.
User Input: Allows users to input their message and choose a shift value for encryption or decryption.
Simple Menu: Users can select whether they want to encrypt or decrypt a message.
How It Works
Encryption: Each letter in the plaintext is shifted forward in the alphabet by the shift value provided by the user. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on.
Decryption: The reverse process, where each letter in the encrypted message is shifted backward by the shift value to retrieve the original plaintext.

Example :

Encryption: 



Message: Hello, World!

Shift: 3

Encrypted Message: Khoor, Zruog!

Decryption:


Encrypted Message: Khoor, Zruog!

Shift: 3

Decrypted Message: Hello, World!


Installation and Usage
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Installation
Clone the repository or download the program files.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher.git

Navigate to the directory where the program is located.

cd caesar-cipher
Running the Program
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Run the Python script:
python caesar_cipher.py

Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your message and choose between encryption and decryption.
Code Structure
encrypt(text, shift): Function to encrypt the given text by shifting its letters by the shift value.

decrypt(text, shift): Function to decrypt the given text by reversing the shift.

main(): Main function that handles user interaction, takes input, and calls the appropriate function based on the user's choice.

Future Improvements
Add support for different alphabets and character sets.
Implement additional cryptographic algorithms.
Improve error handling and input validation.
